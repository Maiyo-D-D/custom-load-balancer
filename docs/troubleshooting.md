# Troubleshooting Guide

This document outlines common issues and solutions encountered during the development and deployment of the load balancer project.

## Common Issues

### 1. Server Not Responding
**Issue:** The server does not respond to requests.  
**Solution:** 
- Check if the server is running. Use `docker ps` to see if the server container is active.
- Review the server logs for any errors. Logs can be found in the `analysis/logs` directory.

### 2. Load Balancer Fails to Distribute Requests
**Issue:** The load balancer is not distributing requests evenly among servers.  
**Solution:** 
- Ensure that the consistent hashing implementation is correctly configured.
- Verify that all server instances are registered with the load balancer.

### 3. Dependency Installation Errors
**Issue:** Errors occur while installing dependencies from `requirements.txt`.  
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you are using the correct Python version. Check the version compatibility of the libraries listed.
- Use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system packages.

### 4. Docker Container Build Failures
**Issue:** The Docker container fails to build.  
**Solution:** 
- Check the Dockerfile for syntax errors or incorrect commands.
- Ensure that all required files are present in the specified paths.

### 5. Performance Issues
**Issue:** The application is slow or unresponsive under load.  
**Solution:** 
- Analyze performance metrics generated by `performance_analysis.py`.
- Consider optimizing the load balancer's request distribution algorithm.
