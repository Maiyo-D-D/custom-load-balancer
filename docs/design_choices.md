# Design Choices Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the design choices made during the development of the load balancer project. Each decision is accompanied by the rationale behind it, providing insight into the project's architecture and implementation.

## Architecture
- **Microservices Architecture**: The project is designed using a microservices architecture to allow for scalability and independent deployment of the server and load balancer components. This separation of concerns simplifies maintenance and enhances the ability to scale individual components based on demand.

## Load Balancing Strategy
- **Consistent Hashing**: The load balancer employs consistent hashing to distribute incoming requests across multiple server instances. This approach minimizes the number of keys that need to be remapped when servers are added or removed, thus improving efficiency and reducing latency.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: The choice of Python as the primary programming language is due to its simplicity and the availability of robust libraries for networking and web services. This facilitates rapid development and prototyping.
- **Docker**: Docker is used for containerization, allowing for consistent environments across development, testing, and production. This choice simplifies deployment and ensures that the application behaves the same way regardless of where it is run.

## Testing
- **Unit and Integration Testing**: The project includes a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of both the server and load balancer components. This testing strategy helps catch issues early in the development process and ensures that changes do not introduce regressions.

## Documentation
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each component of the project includes its own README file, providing specific instructions and details. This modular documentation approach makes it easier for developers to understand and contribute to individual parts of the project.

## Conclusion
The design choices made in this project aim to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable load balancer system. By documenting these decisions, we provide clarity and rationale that can guide future development and enhancements.
